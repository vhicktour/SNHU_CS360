## Project Three: Event Tracking App

### Summary
The Event Tracking App was developed to meet the needs of users who want to manage and track their events efficiently. The app allows users to create, update, view, and delete events. It also includes a login feature that supports new user registration.

### Screens and Features
The app includes the following screens:
- **Login Screen:** Allows users to log in or create an account.
- **Event List Screen:** Displays a list of events in a user-friendly grid.
- **Create Event Screen:** Allows users to add new events.
- **Update Event Screen:** Enables users to modify existing events.
- **SMS Permission Screen:** Prompts users for SMS permissions to send notifications.

The UI was designed with the user in mind, focusing on ease of use and clarity. The clean, minimalistic design ensures that users can navigate the app with ease, and the consistent color scheme provides a visually appealing experience.

### Development Approach
The development process was structured around a combination of user-centered design principles and mobile app development best practices. The code was organized into distinct components, with a focus on reusability and maintainability. Techniques such as the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture were employed to separate concerns and facilitate easier testing.

### Testing
The app was thoroughly tested using the Android Emulator to ensure all functionalities were working as intended. Unit tests were also written for key components to verify their behavior. This rigorous testing process revealed a few bugs, which were promptly fixed, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Innovation and Challenges
One of the key challenges was integrating the SMS permission feature while ensuring that the app remained functional even if the user denied permissions. This required innovative error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### Notable Success
The implementation of the event list grid was particularly successful, showcasing my ability to handle dynamic data display in a user-friendly manner. The responsive design and smooth performance of this component highlight my proficiency in mobile app development.
